DengAI: Predicting Disease Spread

This is an intermediate-level practice competition. Our task is to predict the number of dengue cases each 
week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, precipitation,
 vegetation, and more.

An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics 
can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.
